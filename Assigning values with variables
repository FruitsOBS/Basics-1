/*There are 4 basic ways to initialize variables in C++:

1) int a; // no initializer								
2) int b = 5; // initializer after equals sign				//copy initialization
3) int c(6); // initializer in parenthesis					//Direct initialization
4) int d{ 7 }; // initializer in braces						//List initialization
